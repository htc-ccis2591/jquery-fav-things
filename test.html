        <p class='description'>I enjoy the social experience of tabletop gaming, as it allows me my friends, and a maybe a few newbies, to enjoy a social story telling experience, with adventure, combat,  and a whole lot of randomness. Usually this goes more like Monty Python than Lord Of The Rings though.  </p>

        <p class='description'>Cons are amazing. It is liek for a breif period, nerds truly do rule, and in the hotel of choice, everything goes. Weird costumes, wild parties, and more than crazy occurences wind up happening at these things.  </p>
