        <p class="thing">Sailing</p>
        <span class="showMe">
        
        <img src="./images/sailboat.png">
    
        <p class="desc">This is Windsong II. She's a bit short and a bit fat so she doesn't like to sail
    well when heeled. But because she's small she is also cheap to rent. And we know where
    everything is on board so we love here anyway.</p>

        <p class="thing">Playing guitar</p>
        <span class="showMe">
        
        <img src="./images/strat.png">
        
        
        <p class="desc">I'm not very good but good enough to entertain myself. I have a nice Mexican Strat
    and one of my favorite pastimes is to crank it up and play rock star. I can bumble along with
    most of what comes on KQRS. Only when the kids are gone, though. They hate the noise.</p>
        
        
        </span>
        
        <p class="thing">Learning Spanish and Russian</p>
        <span class="showMe">
        
        <img src="./images/hello.png">
        
        <p class="desc">Not fluent in either but I could survice in a Spanish-speaking country without too
        much trouble. Not so much in Russian. I can say "Hi, how are you" and I can ask
    you your name. I can also say something appropriate if you cut me off in traffic.</p> 
        
        
        </span>
        
        <p class="thing">The Beatles</p>

        <p class="desc">There's nothing that needs to be said about this one. If they aren't on <b>your</b>
        list then you have something seriously wrong with you.</b></p>

        <p class="thing">Pizza</p>
        <span class="hideMe">
        
        <img src="./images/pizza.png">
    
        <p class="desc">Thin crust, thick crust. Hot and fresh for dinner, cold and leftover for breakfast. Sausage, ppepperoni, maybe some onion. I generally like it
    plain and simple. Jetshas been my favorite but lately I've developed a taste for the Med
    from Papa Murphy's. Either one with a good (or bad) Merlot and I'm happy as a clam.</p>

        <img src="./images/salsa.png">
    
        <p class="desc">This is really three things but I love 'em all. The music, the dancing,
    and the stuff you put on your food.</p>
